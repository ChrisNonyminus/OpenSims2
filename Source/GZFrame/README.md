# Gonzo and Rizzo Frameworks

Gonzo (named after the [muppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_(Muppet))), or GZ for short, along with RZ ([Rizzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizzo_the_Rat)), are frameworks found in Maxis games made after 1997 (when Maxis was purchased by EA).

Gonzo handles application objects, and many more. It is practically the foundation of each Maxis game post-1997.

Rizzo, built on top of Gonzo, is an interface to the operating system and includes utility classes.
