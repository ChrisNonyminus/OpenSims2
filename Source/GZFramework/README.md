## GZFramework

GZFramework, along with RZFramework, are frameworks found in Maxis games made after 1997 (when Maxis was purchased by EA).

GZFramework handles things like strings, object management, and more.

RZFramework is an extension of that, built on top of GZFramework.

# Speculation

"GZ" might be short for Gonzo (as in, Gonzo from the Muppets); in The Sims 1, which has symbols in its Mac port, there are mentions of a "Gonzo framework".

If that's the case, "RZ" might also be short for Rizzo.
